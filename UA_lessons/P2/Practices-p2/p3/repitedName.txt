Just to clarify one thing, because many of you are already facing the problem


What happens when I have a parameter which name is exactly the same as one of my attributes?

For instance, in the case of the constructor of Task

that receives a parameter "name"

and has an argument "name"

you should use the pointer "this"
(I will cover it in the next session)

"this" is a pointer to the object that did the call to the method
so "this->name" refers to the attribute of the object

use "this->name=name" to indicate that you assign the parameter "name" to the attribute "name" (represented by "this->name"
